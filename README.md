This repository containes two Jupyter notebooks and a csv file. The two notebooks contain code for scraping data from websites about Mars. Some code was borrowed or inspired by code from Geeks for Geeks and
SaturnCloud. One thing to note: the bar chart for Martian temperatures has the bars hanging from the top of the graph because the temperature readings were all negative. The instructor and TA recommended that I
keep it this way instead of trying to flip the bars to look like a normal bar chart.
